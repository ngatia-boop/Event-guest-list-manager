# ðŸŽ‰ Event Guest List Manager

Welcome to my **Event Guest List Manager** project! This is a JavaScript-based application that lets users manage a dynamic guest list right in the browser â€” no page reloads necessary.

This project was built as part of a **Phase 1 DOM manipulation code challenge**, with a focus on core front-end skills: handling user input, updating the DOM dynamically, and cleanly structuring HTML/CSS/JavaScript files.

---

## ðŸš€ Learning Goals

- Build a functioning guest list application
- Use `event.preventDefault()` to suppress default form actions
- Dynamically update the DOM using JavaScript
- Structure a web project using separate files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `src/index.js`

## ðŸ›  Project Structure

```event-guest-list-manager/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html # HTML layout of the app
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css # Styling for the app
â””â”€â”€ src/
â””â”€â”€ index.js # JavaScript logic for interactivity
```

## âœ… Core Features (Deliverables)

- âœ… Users can **type a guest's name** into an input field.
- âœ… Clicking the **Submit** button adds the guest to the list.
- âœ… The guestâ€™s name is **displayed in a list** below the form.
- âœ… Each guest in the list includes a **"Remove" button** to delete them.
- âœ… Guest list is **limited to 10 entries**. Exceeding triggers an alert.
