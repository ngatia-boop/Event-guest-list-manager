# 🎉 Event Guest List Manager

Welcome to my **Event Guest List Manager** project! This is a JavaScript-based application that lets users manage a dynamic guest list right in the browser — no page reloads necessary.

This project was built as part of a **Phase 1 DOM manipulation code challenge**, with a focus on core front-end skills: handling user input, updating the DOM dynamically, and cleanly structuring HTML/CSS/JavaScript files.

---

## 🚀 Learning Goals

- Build a functioning guest list application
- Use `event.preventDefault()` to suppress default form actions
- Dynamically update the DOM using JavaScript
- Structure a web project using separate files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `src/index.js`

## ✅ Core Features (Deliverables)

- ✅ Users can **type a guest's name** into an input field.
- ✅ Clicking the **Submit** button adds the guest to the list.
- ✅ The guest’s name is **displayed in a list** below the form.
- ✅ Each guest in the list includes a **"Remove" button** to delete them.
- ✅ Guest list is **limited to 10 entries**. Exceeding triggers an alert.
- ✅ Each guest has a **"Toggle RSVP"** button to switch between **Attending** and **Not Attending** status.

## 🌟 Stretch Features

After implementing the core features, I added some extras:

- 🏷️ Guests can be categorized as **Friend, Family, or Colleague**, with visual color tags.
- ⏰ A **timestamp** shows when each guest was added.
- ✏️ An **Edit button** allows users to update a guest’s name directly in the list.
- 🎨 Clean, user-friendly UI with CSS styling for readability and interaction feedback.
